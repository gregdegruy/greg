# Effective C# 6.0 Third Edition, 50 Specific Ways to improve Your C#
Using this repo to log all of the best practices I find in the book. The "50 Specific Ways"/Items will be divided up and referred to just as they were in the books code snippets.

HOWEVER, I have included snippets that you can compile and run on your machines using ?the dotnet? CLI? Much more valuable to see the concepts executable :).

Common Language Runtime (CLR) and Just-In Time (JIT) compiler.

Assume all code snippets use this header:
```
using System;
using static System.Console;
using System.Collection.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```
